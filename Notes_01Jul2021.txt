	whenever we want to run multiple services, together in docker, we use
	docker-compose.yml

1) run a mvc project and mysql both images together
	docker-compose.yml


2) run producer and consumer together in MSK
	docker-componse.yml

We are deploying a docker image in aws



image
container

when you run an image, it runs in a container

	docker images
is same as	docker image ls

	docker ps
is same as 	docker container ls

to remove an image
	docker rmi imagename

but when image is running as container, we need to remove container and then remove image.
but we still can force remove image

	docker rmi -f imagename

to remove container
	docker rm containername


====================
Normalization
	avoid redundancy
	Normal forms
		1NF
		2NF
		3NF

	in every form, the table might be divided into multiple tables
	if data is present in one location, it will be consistent. if same data is present in multiple locations
		ex:
			Attendance
				associate id		name
				23232323		raja
				23232323		Rajan


Views
	without table?		cannot be created without tables.
				cannot be created without query
		inline views
			sub queries are also called as inline view. inline views are not stored in db.

	DMLS on view?
		there is a view called "vw1"
		can we do
			INSERT INTO vw1 ......
			UPDATE INTO vw1 ......

	DML is possible on view sometimes.
		DML on view is allowed only if
			that affects column(s) of only 1 underlying table

	a view is created on a single table. 
	all mandatory columns are coverd by the view query
	insert is possible. Update is possible. delete is possible.
	this is simple view

	a view is created using join
		update is possible but only when that update affect column(s) of 1 table.



JOINS
	
composite key
	combination of columns to act as candiate for primary key

candidate key		=		candidate for primary key

alternate key		=		candidate key when primary key already exists

primary key vs unique key

	unique does not allow duplicates
	unique allow null

	how many null allowed by unique?
	
	null in unique

foreign key constraints
	ON DELETE 
		SET NULL
		RESTRICT		Default
		CASCADE

diff between DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE
	
Clustered vs non clustered index

clustered index is created when we create a primary key

the records are physically stored in the order of clustered index

library
	search book based on title

index sheet
	sorted by title

find the book in index
	go to the location and get the book

index is in particular order
books are also present in that order
	this index is clustered index

books can be in only 1 order

1 clustered index only is possible

difference between while and do-while
do while will execute the loop body atleast once...	do while condition decides second or further iteration
while will check condition and execute if true

	we use when there are arrays
	

in javascript, an object can be denoted as a string:
	{sno:1,firstName:'rama',lastName:'krishna'}		Javascript Object Notation	(JSON)

JSON.parse			converts string into object
JSON.stringify			converts object into string

we are going to create front end and also back end. Between these to ends, the data will be flowing.

INPUT	and supply to the back end and back end will store / manipulate the database
back end will read data from the database and send to front end

the data which is in transit, can be JSON
ARRAY of values
	[1,2,3,4,5,6]	

ARRAY of objects
	[{sno:1,firstName:'rama',lastName:'krishna'},
	{sno:1,firstName:'rama',lastName:'krishna'},
	{sno:1,firstName:'rama',lastName:'krishna'},
	{sno:1,firstName:'rama',lastName:'krishna'}]

objects can have	
	properties
	methods/function
	event

	ex:	text box is an object
		properties:		value, style, id, name, class, etc
		methods/functions:	forEach		items
		events:			change, keyup, keydown, focus, blur


	<input type=range />


1) bind an event to an event handler function using 
	i) event=function
	ii) addEventListener("event", function);

	add multiple events for one object
	removeEventListener



task:
	create a html file with following ui:
	3 checkboxes.	(there should be 3 functions)
	1 button

	events are added to the button only. when? when the checkboxes are checked.
	all events are button click event only.

	when i click the button, 
		either all 3 functions are called. or few of the functions are called.
		or none of the functions called.
		This is BASED ON how many check boxes i clicked.

	when the check boxes are clicked,  the function corresponding to that should be subscribed.
	when check boxes are unchecked, the function should be unsubscribed.

	hint:	subscribe?	addEventListener
	      unsubscribe?	removeEventListener
		you can add multiple functions to one event.

	so when i click button, the subscribed functions should be called.

	clue:
		when i tick the checkbox, subscribe.
		when i untick the checkbox, unsubscribe.



document		represent the root element of the document.
Task:
	1) create a html file with a form. and a button. on clicking the button, the function should be able to traverse through the child elements of the form. and display them in console/alert.
	2) Create a html file with one button. on click, the javascript function should be able to create an input form using DOM.
