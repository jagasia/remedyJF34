controller	vs	Rest controller
	difference between 
	this is used in MVC project
		redirection		return url		
		form submission to the controller

		REST CONTROLLER
			does not support session
			each method is independent conversation

			each method is mapped to an URL	

			each functionality is provided using URL as a micro service

		in rest controller	
			return "hello";			means hello is a value returned
		in controller
			return "hello";			means hello is the url		hello.jsp

		a rest controller is only meant to produce output or do some task. Nothing related to VIEW

amazon cloud

	we created a spring boot application	(rest controller) connects with the database using JPA repository
		GET		retrieve all Entities
		GET		retrieve an enityt by id
		POST		add
		PUT		modify
		DELETE		delete


	we deployed this application in AWS	Elastic Beanstalk container
	
	we were able to access the urls from anywhere

	how this app is able to connect with mysql db?

	we created mysql db in aws using 	RDS		Relational Database Service

	i) AWS Elastic Beanstalk 		application
	ii) RDS					database		and we configured so that it allows 
								public access
								all traffic
								any region

	a rest controller do not have UI		like JSP

	Feign client
		Spring Cloud
			Eureka server and client
			Feign client
			Ribbon		(we did not have in our syllabus)

	what is the use of Feign client?
		allows a spring boot application to access another spring boot application

		our spring boot rest api is deployed in aws beanstalk
		another spring boot mvc project will access that aws app using "Feign client"

		this project is deployed in docker container 	(docker hub)
		so that any client can run this (without even having java in their computer)

		docker run -p 8080:8080 jagindia/mymvc


	





What is set?			collection of distinct elements
				do not allow duplicates		means it will reject not exception
What is abstract class?
				is incomplete. means some methods are implemented some are left to sub classes to implement. Meant to be a super class. cannot be instantiated.
What is static block?
				block executed even before main method. only once

spring vs spring boot
	spring boot encourages convention over configuration

	in spring mvc, component scan base package must be specified.
	in spring boot, if we create controller classes under base package, we need not specify
		convention

	boot has starter dependencies
		group of dependencies and easy to manage

		starter =	spring core, context, context support, etc

	boot has internal tomcat server

	we do not need to download tomcat server at all


configuration
	XML
		component scan base package
		<bean>
	annotations
		@ComponentScan(
		@Bean		or @Component

			@Bean is used only for methods
			@Component is used on the class	(mostly we use pre defined class so we cannot use this)
